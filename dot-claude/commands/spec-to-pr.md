description: Generate code implementation from a feature spec and create a GitHub PR
---

# Spec to PR Command

**Purpose:** Transform a feature spec markdown file into working code and create a GitHub pull request.

## When to Use

Use this command to implement a feature spec:
- **After /question-to-spec:** Creates spec → /spec-to-pr creates PR
- **Manual specs:** You wrote a spec → /spec-to-pr implements it
- **Automated workflow:** Cron job creates specs → cron job creates PRs

**Target cron usage:**
```bash
# Step 1: 9am - Create spec from question
0 9 * * * claude -p "/question-to-spec 'Was there any user feedback in the last 24 hours?'"

# Step 2: 9:15am - Create PR from any new specs
15 9 * * * claude -p "/spec-to-pr"
```

## Workflow

**CRITICAL: This workflow generates real code and creates real PRs. Be thorough.**

### Step 0: Find or Specify Spec File

**Option A: Auto-find most recent spec**
```bash
/spec-to-pr
→ Finds most recent *-YYYY-MM-DD.md in project root
```

**Option B: Specify spec file**
```bash
/spec-to-pr user-feedback-2025-11-14.md
→ Uses the specified file
```

**IMPORTANT:** Spec will be automatically copied to `docs/specifications/` and committed with the PR.

### Step 1: Read and Understand the Spec

1. **Read the spec file completely**
   - Problem: What are we solving?
   - Solution: What's the approach?
   - Implementation: What files need changes?
   - Testing: What test cases are needed?

2. **Extract key information:**
   - Title and feature name
   - Priority and effort estimate
   - Files to modify
   - New files to create
   - Dependencies and blockers
   - Acceptance criteria

3. **Validate the spec:**
   - ✅ Has Problem section with evidence
   - ✅ Has Solution with user experience
   - ✅ Has Implementation with file paths
   - ✅ Has Testing with test cases
   - ❌ If incomplete, ask user to improve spec first

### Step 2: Plan the Implementation

**Before writing code, create an implementation plan:**

1. **Break down the work:**
   - Backend changes (models, API, logic)
   - Frontend changes (UI, components, styling)
   - Database migrations (if needed)
   - Tests (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Documentation updates

2. **Identify dependencies:**
   - What existing code/infrastructure is needed?
   - Any blockers mentioned in the spec?
   - Required external services or APIs?

3. **Determine implementation order:**
   1. Database schema changes (if any)
   2. Backend logic
   3. API endpoints
   4. Frontend integration
   5. Tests
   6. Documentation

**Announce the plan to user:**
```
📋 Implementation plan for "{Feature Title}":

Backend:
- [ ] Add streak_count, last_active_date to User model
- [ ] Create update_streaks() function
- [ ] Add cron job to run daily at 12:01am UTC

Frontend:
- [ ] Add streak display to user profile
- [ ] Add notification for streak milestones

Testing:
- [ ] Unit tests for update_streaks()
- [ ] Integration test for streak notification
- [ ] E2E test for 7-day streak flow

Estimated time: {effort from spec}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Code

**Follow the project's coding standards from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md:**

#### General Guidelines
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Reuse existing patterns
- **Type hints:** Use modern Python 3.9+ generics (`list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`)
- **No defensive programming:** Let errors surface (except for external APIs)
- **Imports at top:** All imports at file top (unless TYPE_CHECKING)
- **No try/except:** Unless handling external API errors
- **Testing strategy:** Integration tests > unit tests (focus on robust e2e)

#### For This Codebase Specifically

**From CLAUDE.md:**
- Avoid single-use functions (inline code unless reused)
- Use Alembic for database migrations (don't generate manually)
- Follow async architecture (use `@job` decorators for async processing)
- Use modern type hints
- Test files should use fixtures from api/tests/AGENTS.md patterns

**Implementation steps:**

1. **Backend changes:**
   - Modify existing files per spec
   - Create new files per spec
   - Add type hints to all functions
   - Follow existing patterns in codebase

2. **Database migrations (if needed):**
   - **DO NOT generate migration files**
   - Provide the command for user to run:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it codel-api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"
     docker exec -it codel-api alembic upgrade head
     ```

3. **Tests:**
   - Follow patterns from api/tests/AGENTS.md
   - Use composable factory-style fixtures
   - Focus on integration/e2e tests (not brittle unit tests)
   - Test happy path + edge cases from spec

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update relevant README files (if needed)
   - Add docstrings to new functions
   - Comment complex logic (sparingly)

### Step 4: Run Quality Checks

**MANDATORY: Use the test-runner skill**

Before creating PR, verify code quality:

```bash
# Step 0: Format code
cd api && just ruff

# Step 1: Type check
cd api && just lint

# Step 2: Run tests
cd api && just test-all-mocked
```

**If any step fails:**
1. Fix the issues
2. Re-run the failing step
3. Continue only when all pass

**DO NOT create PR if quality checks fail.**

### Step 5: Copy Spec to docs/specifications/

**IMPORTANT: Specs must be committed to the repository as part of the PR.**

```bash
# Copy spec from top-level to docs/specifications/
cp {spec-file} docs/specifications/

# Example:
cp user-feedback-2025-11-14.md docs/specifications/
```

This ensures the spec is version-controlled with the implementation.

### Step 6: Create GitHub PR

**Use git commands to create PR:**

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/{feature-slug}
   ```

2. **Stage and commit changes (including spec):**
   ```bash
   git add {files changed} docs/specifications/{spec-filename}
   git commit -m "{commit message}

   {Brief description of changes}

   Implements: docs/specifications/{YYYY-MM-DD-feature-slug}.md

   🤖 Generated with Claude Code
   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

3. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/{feature-slug}
   ```

4. **Create PR using gh CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --title "{Feature Title}" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Feature: {Title}

   **Spec:** docs/specifications/{YYYY-MM-DD-feature-slug}.md
   **Priority:** {P0/P1/P2/P3}
   **Effort:** {XS/S/M/L/XL}

   ## Problem
   {Summary from spec}

   ## Solution
   {Summary from spec}

   ## Changes Made
   - {Change 1}
   - {Change 2}
   - {Change 3}

## Configuration

### Spec File Location
```bash
# Default: Find most recent in current directory
/spec-to-pr

# Specify file (deterministic filename for cron)
/spec-to-pr user-feedback-2025-11-14.md

# Spec will be automatically copied to docs/specifications/ and committed with the PR
```

### Branch Naming
```bash
# Default: feature/{slug}
/spec-to-pr

# Custom branch prefix
/spec-to-pr --branch-prefix=implement-

# Results in: implement-7-day-streak
```

## Edge Cases

### Spec File Not Found
**Action:** Return error with instructions
```
❌ Spec file not found

Searched: ./ (project root)
No specs found matching *-YYYY-MM-DD.md

Did you mean:
- Run /question-to-spec first to create a spec
- Specify file: /spec-to-pr spec-filename.md
```

### Multiple Recent Specs
**Action:** Implement the most recent, list others
```
Found 3 specs from today:
1. user-feedback-2025-11-14.md (most recent)
2. funnel-2025-11-14.md
3. retention-2025-11-14.md

Implementing most recent: user-feedback-2025-11-14.md

To implement others:
- /spec-to-pr funnel-2025-11-14.md
- /spec-to-pr retention-2025-11-14.md
```

### Quality Checks Fail
**Action:** DO NOT create PR, report errors
```
❌ Quality checks failed - PR not created

✅ Formatting: Pass
❌ Type checking: 3 errors
  - api/src/models/user.py:42: Missing type hint
  - api/src/cron/streaks.py:15: Incompatible types
  - api/src/cron/streaks.py:23: Undefined name 'datetime'

❌ Tests: 2 failures
  - test_update_streaks_daily
  - test_streak_notification_sent

Fix these issues and run /spec-to-pr again.
```

### Database Migration Needed
**Action:** Provide commands, DO NOT create migration
```
⚠️ Database migration needed

This spec requires schema changes:
- Add columns: streak_count, last_active_date to users table

Run these commands to create and apply migration:

docker exec -it codel-api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add streak fields to User"
docker exec -it codel-api alembic upgrade head

After migration is created, re-run: /spec-to-pr
```

## Skills Used

1. **test-runner** (skill) - Run quality checks (ruff, lint, tests)
2. **Project patterns** (from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) - Coding standards

## Notes

- **Specs are committed:** Always copy spec to docs/specifications/ and include in PR
- **Code quality matters:** Always run test-runner before creating PR
- **Follow existing patterns:** Look at similar code in the codebase
- **Don't over-engineer:** Implement exactly what the spec says (no extras)
- **Type everything:** All functions need type hints
- **Test thoroughly:** Cover happy path + edge cases from spec
- **Commit messages:** Include spec reference (docs/specifications/) and emoji
- **PR descriptions:** Link to spec in docs/specifications/, include summary, list changes
- **Both copies updated:** Update both top-level spec (local) and docs/specifications/ (committed) with PR info

Remember: The goal is to turn a **feature spec** into **working code** with a **reviewable PR** that includes the spec in version control.
