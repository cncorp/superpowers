# Product Analytics Skill

Framework for transforming raw product data into actionable insights.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Analyze user behavior patterns
- Identify engagement trends
- Investigate feature usage
- Understand user segments
- Find opportunities for improvement
- Support product decisions with data

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Define the Question

Start with a clear, specific question:
- ❌ Bad: "How are users doing?"
- ✅ Good: "What types of 1:1 messages from Codel get the most positive reactions from users?"

**Write down:**
- Primary question
- Success metric
- Time range
- User segment (if applicable)

### 2. Collect Comprehensive Data

**IMPORTANT:** Use the sql-reader skill to query production data.

Collect:
- **Quantitative data:** Counts, rates, distributions, trends
- **Qualitative data:** Actual message content, user names, specific examples
- **Context data:** Time of day, user characteristics, conversation state

**Best practices:**
- Query at different granularities (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Get both aggregates AND individual examples
- Include negative cases (what DIDN'T work)
- Gather enough data to see patterns (not just outliers)

### 3. Create Structured Analysis

**MANDATORY:** Create a markdown file with the following sections:

#### Executive Summary
```markdown
# {Topic} Analysis

**Analysis Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Time Range:** {e.g., "Last 30 days" or "All time"}
**Total Records Analyzed:** {number}

## Key Findings
1. {Most important insight}
2. {Second most important insight}
3. {Third most important insight}

## Top Recommendation
{One-sentence actionable recommendation}
```

#### Metrics Overview
```markdown
## Metrics Overview

| Metric | Value | Benchmark | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Total X | 1,234 | - | - |
| Conversion Rate | 12.5% | 10% | ✅ Above target |
| Engagement Rate | 0.7% | - | ⚠️ Low |
```

#### Detailed Analysis Tables

**CRITICAL:** Use tables to organize data.

**Example: Reaction Analysis**
```markdown
| Reaction Type | Count | % of Total | Top User | Pattern |
|---------------|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| Loved | 61 | 85.9% | craig (35) | Meta-commentary |
| Liked | 10 | 14.1% | Varied | Practical info |
| Disliked | 3 | 4.2% | samuel, Mary, joe | Suggested responses |
```

**For each data point, ask:**
- What does this number mean?
- Is this good or bad?
- What's the trend?
- Who are the outliers?

#### Pattern Analysis

Identify and name patterns:

```markdown
## Pattern 1: The "Power User Effect"
**Observation:** craig provides 49% of all reactions (35 out of 71)

**Analysis:**
- One user drives nearly half of all engagement
- This user is highly engaged with coaching
- Uses reactions as a feedback mechanism
- May not represent typical user behavior

**Implication:** Engagement metrics may be skewed by power users
```

**Pattern Template:**
```markdown
## Pattern {N}: {Name}
**Observation:** {What you see in the data}
**Analysis:** {Why this matters, what it means}
**Implication:** {So what? What does this mean for the product?}
```

#### User Segmentation

If applicable, segment users:
```markdown
## User Segments

### High Engagers (n=3)
- **Who:** craig, karen, Mallory
- **Behavior:** Regular reactions, loves meta-commentary
- **Need:** Growth-oriented coaching

### Low Engagers (n=10)
- **Who:** Most users
- **Behavior:** Rarely react, passive consumption
- **Need:** Unknown - may be satisfied, may not see value in reactions

### Negative Reactors (n=3)
- **Who:** samuel, Mary, joe
- **Behavior:** Used dislike button
- **Need:** Different message types, less presumption
```

#### Qualitative Analysis

**CRITICAL:** Don't just show numbers. Explain WHY.

```markdown
## Why These Patterns Exist

### Hypothesis 1: Meta-commentary resonates because...
- Provides immediate positive reinforcement
- Uses specific examples from user's own behavior
- Celebrates growth (motivating)
- Emoji usage (🌟 💞) conveys warmth

**Evidence:**
- 85% of craig's loved reactions are meta-commentary
- Common phrases: "Notice the shift", "Let yourself feel"

### Hypothesis 2: Suggested responses are polarizing because...
- Some users want help (craig)
- Others feel it's presumptuous (joe, Mary)
- Depends on user preference and communication style

**Evidence:**
- craig loved 5+ suggested responses
- joe and Mary both disliked suggested responses
- No middle ground - either love or hate
```

#### Failure Modes

**IMPORTANT:** Always include what went wrong.

```markdown
## What Didn't Work

### Disliked Message Analysis

| Date | User | Message Type | Why Disliked | Fix |
|------|------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| 2025-11-14 | samuel | Direct Reply | Fabricated quote | Never use quotes unless verbatim |
| 2025-10-16 | Mary | Suggested Response | Felt inauthentic | Personalize feature to user preference |
| 2025-09-14 | joe | Suggested Response | Presumptuous | Ask first if user wants drafts |

**Pattern:** 2 of 3 dislikes are suggested responses
**Root cause:** One-size-fits-all approach to a preference-based feature
**Recommended fix:** Add user setting for suggested responses
```

### 4. Data Visualization Recommendations

While you can't create charts directly, recommend visualizations:

```markdown
## Recommended Visualizations

1. **Time series:** Reactions per week (identify trends)
2. **Distribution:** Histogram of reaction types
3. **Funnel:** Messages sent → reactions received
4. **Heatmap:** Reaction type by user segment
5. **Comparative:** Loved vs. Disliked message characteristics
```

### 5. Statistical Context

Provide context for numbers:

```markdown
## Statistical Context

- **Sample size:** 71 reactions out of 10,000+ messages
- **Confidence:** 0.7% reaction rate (low but consistent)
- **Bias:** Power user skew (49% from one user)
- **Significance:** 96% positive rate is statistically meaningful
- **Trend:** Need historical data to identify trends
```

### 6. Insights and Recommendations

**Format:**
```markdown
## Key Insights

### Insight 1: Meta-commentary drives engagement
**What we learned:** Messages with 🌟 celebrating user growth get most love (85%)

**Why it matters:** Users value affirmation and progress tracking

**What to do:**
1. Increase frequency of meta-commentary
2. Train AI to identify more growth moments
3. A/B test different affirmation styles

**Success metric:** Increase reaction rate from 0.7% to 1.5%

### Insight 2: Suggested responses are divisive
**What we learned:** Some users love drafts (craig: 5+ loved), others hate them (2 dislikes)

**Why it matters:** One-size-fits-all approach fails for preference-based features

**What to do:**
1. Add user preference: "Do you want message drafts?"
2. Default to OFF, let users opt-in
3. Track adoption and satisfaction by preference

**Success metric:** 0% dislikes for suggested responses among opted-in users
```

- **Activation:** When do users first engage?
- **Retention:** Do users come back?
- **Frequency:** Daily, weekly, monthly usage?

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Feature adoption:** What % use each feature?
- **Success paths:** What do successful users do?
- **Drop-off points:** Where do users stop?
- **Preference clusters:** Do user types emerge?

### Quality Patterns
- **Satisfaction signals:** Likes, completion rates
- **Dissatisfaction signals:** Dislikes, churn, support tickets
- **Value moments:** When do users express gratitude?
- **Friction points:** Where do users get stuck?

### Temporal Patterns
- **Time of day:** When are users most active?
- **Day of week:** Weekday vs. weekend usage
- **Seasonality:** Monthly/quarterly trends
- **Cohorts:** New vs. old users

**Time Range:** All time
**Total Reactions:** 71

## Executive Summary
- 96% positive reaction rate (61 loved, 10 liked, 3 disliked)
- One power user (craig) drives 49% of all reactions
- Meta-commentary messages get most love; suggested responses are polarizing

## Top Recommendation
Add user preference setting for suggested responses to reduce dislikes and increase satisfaction.

```

## Integration with Other Skills

**Before this skill:**
- Use sql-reader to query production data

**After this skill:**
- Use feature-spec-writer to create PM specs
- Use linear-manager to create tickets

## Notes

- **Be thorough:** Surface-level analysis isn't useful
- **Show your work:** Include query examples and data samples
- **Think like a PM:** Ask "so what?" for every finding
- **Be honest:** Include limitations and uncertainties
- **Make it actionable:** Every insight should lead to a decision

Remember: Good analysis tells a story. What did we learn? Why does it matter? What should we do?
